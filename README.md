# ThreatAgent Community Repository
## Purpose
This repository serves as a place to put any open-sourced software under
ThreatAgent that doesn't really stand as it's own tool but is none the
less useful.

## Issues
Issues will be reviewed frequently and collaboration will be a standard.
Feel free to open a pull request up with additions or fixes. Anything in
the repo is fair game.

In addition any issues with [ThreatAgent Drone](https://www.threatagent.com)
can be reported [here](https://github.com/threatagent/community/issues).
This ensures a quick work flow where communication will be simpler.

Currently the ThreatAgent community repo contains: 
* [Phishing Templates](phishing/templates)
* [API examples and documentation](api)

## Contributing
