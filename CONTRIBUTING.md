This file is a general contribution guidelines for the community repo.

contribution guidelines.
* [Phishing Templates](phishing/templates/CONTRIBUTING.md)

As a rule of thumb make sure anything you try to contribute is your own
work or work that's been open sourced.

Open sourcing parts of ThreatAgent helps us help you. If you've got
something that could be added feel free to open a pull request with a
brief description of what changes you've made or an issue with a summary
of what you'd like to see. We'll make sure to check it out and offer
opinions and help.

While we don't take feature requests for our product if it's obvious
people want something or if you can put your code where your mouth is
and write it we'd be glad to add it.
